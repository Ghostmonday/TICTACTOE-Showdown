## Prompt Sent to All Agents:

You are a [language] developer. You will be building a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game using idiomatic [language] style. Use no external libraries.

ðŸŸ© **Step 01: Initialize Game State**

Your task is to define the data structures necessary to represent the game board (3x3), track the current player (X or O), and track the game state (e.g., in progress, draw, win). Only complete this step and wait for further instructions.

Do not implement the game loop or any logic beyond this.
