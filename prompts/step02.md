# Step 02: Render Game Board

## Prompt Sent to All Agents:

Using your assigned programming language, write a function or procedure that renders the current game board to the console.

- The board should be displayed as a 3x3 grid using the current state of the board data structure.
- Use clear formatting so users can easily see which cells are filled and which are available.
- Do not handle input or game logic in this step.
- Use only standard library functions â€” no third-party dependencies.

This step is display-only. Wait for further instructions before implementing gameplay or interaction.
