# Analysis: Step 02 - Render Game Board

## Summary
Each agent implemented a board rendering function that visually displays the current state of the 3x3 game board in the console.

### Observations

- **Python**: Used a simple `render_board()` function with row string joining and clear separators.
- **Ruby**: Introduced a `display_board` method using interpolated string output and grid formatting.
- **Pascal**: Implemented a `DisplayBoard` procedure with nested helper function for enum conversion and indexed grid display.
- **C++**: Added a `display()` method to the `Board` class with switch-case rendering and STL array usage.

### Tradeoffs

- **Pascal** was the most verbose but highly structured.
- **Ruby** was the most concise, using dynamic interpolation.
- **C++** offered strong type safety, though it required the most setup.
- **Python** balanced simplicity and clarity.

All implementations adhered to the prompt by avoiding game logic or user input.
