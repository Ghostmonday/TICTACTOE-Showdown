# Analysis: Step 01 - Initialize Game State

## Overview
Each AI agent successfully defined a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board, tracked player turns, and stored a game state. The implementations reflect the idiomatic patterns of their respective languages.

## Language Comparisons

### Python
- Used list-of-lists for the board
- Simple string and variable setup
- Light, readable, but lacks type enforcement

### Ruby
- Used a class with instance variables
- Board represented with numbered strings ("1" to "9")
- Used symbols for game state (`:in_progress`)
- Expressive and clean, good Ruby style

### Pascal
- Strong procedural layout with global variables
- Used enums (`TCellState`, `TGameState`) for clarity
- Introduced `MoveCount` for later draw detection
- Verbose but highly structured

### C++
- Fully object-oriented design
- `Board`, `GameState`, and enums for `CellState`, `GameStatus`
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Modern C++ idioms, STL use, strong encapsulation

## Tradeoffs
- **Typed languages (C++, Pascal)** offer robustness and structure but are more verbose.
- **Dynamic languages (Python, Ruby)** are faster to write and simpler, but require careful discipline later for correctness.

## Conclusion
This first step reflects each language's philosophy: verbosity and structure vs. flexibility and speed. All setups are clean and ready for next-phase logic.
